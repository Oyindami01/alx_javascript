**DESCRIPTION**

This repository documents the things I learnt this week in JavaScript.

**TASK**
Below are some of the things I practiced with:

    How to create variables and constants
    What are differences between var, const and let. The use of Var was completely avoided in all tasks.
    How to use the if, if ... else statements
    How to use comments to give a mini description of steps taken.
    How to affect values to variables
    How to use while and for loops. I learnt the difference between "for in" loops and "for of" loops when I was attempting task 3.

**WHAT I LEARNT**

- What is a function and how to use functions.
- Scope of variables.
- Arithmetic operators and how to use them
- How to import a file

**CHALLENGES**

During this learning journey, I covered various JavaScript concepts and at the same time, I had issues with importing and using external files/modules. I watched so many youTube videos and even almost got a Udemy course on javascript.
I hope to practice more and understand better.
